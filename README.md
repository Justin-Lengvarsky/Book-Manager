# Book-Manager

This CRUD application allows users to create and maintain books that they have read. This app displays the user's favorite quotes from the book, their personal rating of the book and each novel comes with a link that will bring the user to Goodreads to find more informatin on that particular story.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, jQuery, EJS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

As I continued to read more and more books in my freetime, I've always wanted a simple interface to show me all my favorite reads. That was the primary goal of this app. I only created three pages to make the layout simple to navigate and keep CRUD requests quick to access. THe trickiest part of the app was implementing Put requests, as I had to store data from the displayed book into the Update Book form as soon as it is loaded. 

## Lessons Learned:

As my first full stack web application, I was able to really understand CRUD methods. Creating this app came with a lot more moving parts which mean't I had to be able to test things more efficiently. I also learned that it is more efficient to complete the functionality of the app before finalizing the styling of the app. It was important to not underestimate the difficulty of successfully sending data from the server and make sure I truly understood how it worked. 

It would have been great if I had more time to add more types of data to each book, however I knew it was better to perfect the basic fuctionality before expanding. I will be utiliing React.js in my future full stack projects, so it was important to not spend too much time while not using React.js.
